<h2>Key Ideas</h2>

<li>Processor (CPU) vs RAM trade-off: A powerful CPU is great for fast processing of tasks, but without enough RAM, your system can still lag under load or multitasking. Conversely, plenty of RAM but with a weak CPU also limits performance.</li>

<li>Budget limitations: Usually you can’t get both top CPU and lots of RAM at the same price; you have to balance what you need most.</li>

<li>Usage purpose matters: Depending on what you do — gaming, video editing, office work, web browsing, multitasking — one component may be more important than the other.</li>
