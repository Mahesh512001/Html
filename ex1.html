 <p>From the oldest living city in the world, Kashi is one of them. The city Varanasi in ancient times was known as Kashi; therefore, the name of the temple is the <strong>Kashi Vishwanath Temple.</strong> Mark Twain, English literature and author, has also depicted Kashi. It is believed that the Ganga has the power to wash away the sins of the sinners. It was the home of lords Shiva and Parvati, although the origin of Kashi is unknown till today. Along with the jyotirlinga of Shiva, there is the jyotirlinga of Vishwanath or Vishveshvara. Inspired by the Kashi Vishwanath temple, many different temples across India were built in its style.  </p>
 <h1>Kingdom of Kashi</h1>
 <p>
 King kasha expanded the city of Kashi. He was the grandson of kshatravriddhas and the great-grandson of Ayu. So on the name of king ‘Kasha,’ the town of Varanasi was known as Kashi. The kingdom of Kashi was a historical Indian province situated in the area near the capital city Varanasi. The river Varuna was bounded to the north, and Asi to the south, and the east part has Son river. At the beginning of the 6th century BCE, in northern India, there were 16 ‘mahajanapadas’ from which Kashi was one of them. The Son river was the western part of the state ‘Magadh.’</p>
 <p>
 Technically, the province of Kashi today would be overlooked by the Bhojpuri people. As stated in the Puranas, Kashi mahajanapada might still be greater than covered in Panch Kosh Kashi. Despite the superiority of Magadh, in the era of Chanakya, Kashi was still the centre for Secular and Vedic education. As per the report by the Chinese travellers, when Varanasi appeared under the significance of Buddhism, Shahabad was the sovereignty of Hindu Shaivite culture. Varanasi was one of the prosperous cities of India, known for its wealth and extravagance as per the Jataka Tales.</p>

 <h1>Sangam</h1>
 <p>This is the point where the brown water of the Ganga meets the green water of the Yamuna, along with the mythical Saraswati, which remains unseen but believed to run underground. It is located about 7 km from Civil Lines, overlooked by the eastern ramparts of the Akbar Fort.

Wide flood plains and muddy banks protrude towards the sacred Sangam. At the mid-river point priests perch on small platforms to perform puja and assist the devout in their ritual ablutions in the shallow waters. A dip in the Sangam water is supposed to be the holiest of the holy pilgrimages for the devout Hindu. Boats to the Sangam can be rented by pilgrims and tourists alike at the ghat near the fort. It is during the Maha Kumbh/Kumbh that the Sangam truly comes alive, attracting the devout from all across the country. </p>
 <h1>Kumbh Mela and Sangam</h1>
 <p>
 Prayag in modern-day Allahabad is believed to be the most important pilgrimage centre for Hindus. Traditionally river confluences are regarded as auspicious places, but in Sangam, the significance of the confluence is most pious because here, the holy Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati meet to become one.</p>
 <p>
 The Maha Kumbh Mela is the largest religious congregation in India, attended by millions. The over month-long fair is marked by the construction of a massive tented township, complete with cottages, huts, platforms, civic facilities, administrative and security measures. It is organized immaculately by the government, the local authorities and the police. The mela is especially renowned for the presence of an extraordinary array of religious ascetics – sadhus and mahants – enticed from remote hideaways in forests, mountains and caves. Once astrologers have determined the propitious bathing time or Kumbhayog, the first to hit the water is by legions of Naga Sadhus or Naga Babas, who cover their naked bodies with ash and wear hair in long dreadlocks. The sadhus, who see themselves as guardians of the faith, approach the confluence at the scheduled time with all the pomp and bravado of a charging army. The most recent Maha Kumbh Mela was held in 2013 and the next is due in 2025.</p>

 <h1>Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid conflict</h1>
 <p>From the oldest living city in the world, Kashi is one of them. The city Varanasi in ancient times was known as Kashi; therefore, the name of the temple is the <strong>Kashi Vishwanath Temple.</strong> Mark Twain, English literature and author, has also depicted Kashi. It is believed that the Ganga has the power to wash away the sins of the sinners. It was the home of lords Shiva and Parvati, although the origin of Kashi is unknown till today. Along with the jyotirlinga of Shiva, there is the jyotirlinga of Vishwanath or Vishveshvara. Inspired by the Kashi Vishwanath temple, many different temples across India were built in its style.  </p>
 <h1>Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid conflict</h1>
 <p>
 Despite the town’s great age, there are few surviving monuments of any antiquity. Close to the modern town are several mounds marking the site of ancient Ayodhya. These have not yet been adequately explored by archaeologists. The Babri Masjid (“Mosque of Bābur”) was built in the early 16th century by the Mughal emperor Bābur on a site traditionally identified as Rama’s birthplace and as the location of an ancient Hindu temple, the Ram Janmabhoomi. Because of its significance to both Hindus and Muslims, the site was often a matter of contention. In 1990, riots in northern India followed the storming of the mosque by Hindu nationalists intent on erecting a temple on the site; the ensuing crisis brought down the V. P. Singh-led National Front government at the center. Singh, who did not support BJP president L.K. Advani’s Rath Yatra (“Chariot Tour”) from Somnath to Ayodhya in September–October 1990, was forced to resign after the BJP withdrew support for his government and he lost a vote of no confidence in November 1990. Two years later, on December 6, 1992, the three-story mosque was demolished in a few hours by a crowd of Hindu nationalists. It was estimated that more than 2,000 people died in the rioting that swept through India following the mosque’s destruction. An investigative commission led by Manmohan Singh Liberhan, a retired judge, was formed in 1992 but did not issue a report until 2009. The report, when it finally appeared, caused an uproar because it blamed several leading figures from the pro-Hindu BJP for the mosque’s destruction. A court ruling in 2010 divided the land between Hindus and Muslims, but that decision was overturned in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which entrusted the site exclusively to Hindus and directed the state to grant an alternate site in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board, which had claimed possession of the Babri Masjid.</p>
 <p>
 The temple complex, spread over an area of 70 acres (28 hectares), is expected to be built in phases; the first phase was completed in time for the consecration ceremony. The main temple will have a total area of 57,400 square feet (5,330 square meters) and will have three floors and 12 gates. Experts in the hospitality sector expect the new temple to create thousands of jobs in Ayodhya and its neighboring towns. Pop. (2001) 49,417; (2011) 55,890.</p>
