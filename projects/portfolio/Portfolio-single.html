<p align="justify">
Hi, I’m <strong>Mahesh Chaurasiya</strong>
I recently completed my graduation and have been building my skills in web development. I enjoy learning and creating projects using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, .NET, Angular, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and React.</strong><br><br>

I’m curious about new technologies and always try to improve my problem-solving and coding skills. Apart from technical learning, I also focus on improving my communication and interview preparation to become a better professional.<br><br>

My goal is to grow as a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Consultant / Full-Stack Developer, contributing to meaningful projects and continuously upgrading my knowledge.
